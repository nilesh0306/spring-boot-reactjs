# Listify React JS Frontend
This is the frontend of Listify that allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items. The application uses the following technologies:

- [React.js](https://react.dev/): A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that provides fast and efficient building and bundling of front-end applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build custom user interfaces.
